# Evergreen Bank
### CS 157A Final project
**By: Grant Biellak and Chloe Pham**

The goal of this project was to make a user-friendly banking system that encompasses CRUD operations utilizing MySQL.
All of the features of our banking system are implemented under the context that this is an in class project
and are not meant to be fully accurate to what an actual banking system would look like. 

The requirements to run this project are as follows:
### 1. Java Environment
* Azulu Zulu JDK 25 installed
* The projects SDK in the IDE must be set to zulu-25

### 2. Database Requirements
* MySQL server 8.0 or higher installed
* The MySQL root user must be available with full permissions (or a different user with full permissions)
* src/main/java/f25/cs157a/evergreenbank/mysql-connector-j-9.5.0.jar set as a maven dependency
* Either the DatabaseInit or create_schema.sql file must be run before starting

To run the program simply run the Launcher.java file from your IDE
